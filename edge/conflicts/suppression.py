"""M3 — false-positive suppression. Owner B. **Read this file twice.**

A naive TTC implementation on Indian urban footage will emit hundreds of
conflicts per minute and every one of them will be garbage. The six rules here
are what stand between the conflict engine and an unusable event stream.

======  ==========================  ==================================================
Rule    Source                      Why it fires
======  ==========================  ==================================================
1       Velocity noise              Detection jitter creates a phantom closing component
2       Lane-splitting two-wheelers Motorcycles filtering between cars are genuinely
                                    close — and that is *normal traffic*, not a near-miss
3       Queued traffic at a signal  Stopped vehicles have tiny separation; C < 0 gives
                                    a meaningless TTC of zero
4       Identity switches           A teleporting track implies an enormous velocity
5       Far-field geometry          Metre error explodes near the horizon
6       No debouncing               At 25 FPS one 2-second encounter emits ~50 events
======  ==========================  ==================================================

**Rule 2 deserves its own paragraph.** Lane discipline on Indian roads is not
what the surrogate-safety literature from Sweden assumes. Motorcycles
filtering between slow cars produce TTC values that look alarming and
represent entirely routine behaviour. Without this rule the event stream is
almost entirely two-wheelers doing something completely normal, and recall
against C's human labels is dismal — because the human labeller marked none of
it. This is the single most important adaptation of the method to the road we
are actually measuring, and it is worth saying out loud in the pitch.

Every rule is individually toggleable under ``suppression:`` in config, so its
effect can be *shown* rather than asserted (edge PRD 6.4).

        Three conditions must hold together:

        1. **Parallel.** Headings agree within ``parallel_heading_deg``.
        2. **Steady lateral gap.** Over the recent window the sideways
           separation has a standard deviation below ``lateral_stability_m``.
           A vehicle genuinely cutting across shows a collapsing gap and fails
           this.
        3. **Offset, not in line.** The lateral gap is at least
           ``min_lateral_offset_m``, so the two are travelling on parallel
           paths rather than one behind the other.

        Condition 3 is the one that is easy to omit and expensive to omit.
        Without it, a car following directly behind another is also "parallel
        with a steady lateral gap", so every genuine rear-end conflict would be
        suppressed along with the filtering motorcycles. The lateral gap is
        what tells the two apart: a follower shares the path (gap ~0), a
        filterer runs beside it (gap ~1.5 m).

        Note that the rule deliberately does **not** test longitudinal
        distance. A motorcycle closing on the gap between two cars from 15 m
        back is still filtering, and the circle model will report an alarming
        TTC for it the whole way in, because the circles are far fatter than a
        motorcycle straddling a lane line. What makes it harmless is that the
        lateral gap never closes — which is exactly what conditions 2 and 3
        test, at any following distance.

        Condition 2 measures spread, not trend. Fitting a closing *rate*
        instead was tried on the demo clip and was four times worse: 34 events
        against 8. The road bends, so the reference heading rotates, and a
        least-squares slope over half a second picks that rotation up as 1 to
        2 m/s of apparent convergence even while the gap is plainly steady.
        Spread over the same window stays well inside the threshold. The
        variance test is also insensitive to its own threshold here - 0.75,
        1.5 and 3.0 m all give the same eight events - so it is not a knife
        edge that happens to sit in the right place.

        **Condition 1 is skipped when the slower vehicle is barely moving.**
        Its heading is computed from its velocity, so below walking pace it is
        not a measurement at all. On the demo clip this was the single largest
        source of false severe events: a car crawling in congestion showed
        headings scattered over 50 degrees, the parallelism test failed on that
        noise, and a car passing cleanly in the *adjacent lane* was reported as
        a severe conflict. Two cars are modelled as circles of radius 2.0 m
        each, so on a 3.5 m lane they always overlap laterally; without rule 2
        every overtake in the next lane becomes a near-miss. Testing
        parallelism against a direction that cannot be measured is worse than
        not testing it, because it fails open.
