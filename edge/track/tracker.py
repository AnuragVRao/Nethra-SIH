"""ByteTrack identity association. Owner A.

Ultralytics ships ByteTrack; we use it as shipped, through ``model.track(...,
persist=True)``. The tracker config is written out from ``edge/config.yaml`` so
there is one place where thresholds live, not two.

**Do not change trackers mid-sprint.** If the switch rate disappoints, report
it honestly in the accuracy table. The integration cost of a swap at hour 12
will exceed the benefit every time.

**Why identity switches matter more here than in most projects.** In an
ordinary detection demo an ID switch is cosmetic. Here it is catastrophic: when
track 87 jumps to a vehicle 15 metres away, the smoothed velocity registers an
enormous step, and the conflict engine sees something apparently doing
200 km/h straight at another vehicle. One ID switch can manufacture one false
*severe* event, and severe events are the headline number.

That is why the projection stage drops any track exceeding
``geometry.max_speed_kmh`` outright, and why the switch rate is measured
(``hygiene.py``) rather than assumed.
